    <h3>Pastry Crust</h3>

        <li>Butter or spray a 9-inch pie pan with a removable bottom – making sure it is has been adequately sprayed. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place flour, salt and sugar in a food processor pulse for a couple of times to mix ingredients.</li>
        <li>Throw in butter and pulse until rough dough forms.</li>
        <li>Then add egg yolk - pulse until the dough barely comes.</li>
        <li>Remove dough place on a work surface - knead just enough to incorporate all the dough. Working the dough as little as possible.</li>
        <li>Do not overwork the dough; otherwise it’ll be too tough. When it’s ready, the dough will be barely moistened and come together into a ball.</li>
        <li>Lightly press the dough on the prepare pie pan – working from the center up until the bottom and sides are fully covered with pastry – again be very gentle when pressing the dough onto the pie pan.</li>
        <li>Place pie pan in the freezer and freeze for at least 30 minutes or more this helps prevent the dough from rising- if you are in a rush brick, then bake with beans to prevent rising.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and place rack in center of oven.</li>
        <li>Bake crust for about 20 to 25 minutes or until the crust is dry and golden browned. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
