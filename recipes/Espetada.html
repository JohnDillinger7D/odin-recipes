    <h1>Espetada</h1>
    <img src="Espetada.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Soft cuts of beef — such as tenderloin, sirloin, or short loin — are cut into uniform cubes, seasoned with crushed garlic and bay (laurel) leaves, and skewered on bay wood. <\p>
    <p>A traditional method dictates grilling espetada over grape wood embers, although other types of non-resinous wood may be used. </p>
    <p>Over the years, the original espetada evolved into other varieties with pork, various sausages, seafood, and vegetables, although beef espetada is still regarded as the most popular one</p>
